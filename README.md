# Trainingsoverzich Larissa Klaassen

## The context of Larissa Klaassen (test 1)

Larissa can only see for 1% of human sight. Therefore, visually appealing en color coded schemes are of no use to her. Instead she uses a screen reader to consume webpages en applications. Additionally she can use a 'brailleleesregel' but that is not somehting she does often.
In her case, there are a few habits and characteristics that are important:

- Larissa does get _programs_ but makes her own _trainingprogrammes_.
- Larissa uses the screen reader **Jaws**, which intercepts the code from the cpu to gpu.
- Larissa her favourite key is `tab`, and tables can not be reached with `tab`.
- Larissa loves fitness and lifting excercises she keeps track of progress.
- Larissa is a chaotic person and needs some order.

## Questions Test 2

- Train je maar 1 keer per dag of kan je ook meerdere trainingen hebben?

## Results Test 2

- Buttons for navigation are good, very nice that feedback is immediately given at change.
- Headinglevel should be adjusted
- Some way to navigate through the year quickly (and not into negative weeknumbers)
- Date picker would be nice for interesting dates
- Today and tomorrow are most important, she usually looks for how late and what activity. Further down the road she mostly wants to know what activity in global.
- Some contrast in focussed element is nice to navigate faster.

TODO:

- Today and tomorrow elaborated view
  - enable focusstate with tab & other keys maybe

## Results test 3

- Fijn gedtailleerde view van vandaag en morgen
- Knoppen en immediate feedback is fijn.
- Date-picker kan beter onder het weekoverzicht om verwarring te voorkomen dat de week leeg is.
  - week 'x' -> content -> week verder/terug
- Dezelfde detaillering van vandaag en morgen zou ook fijn zijn in weekoverzicht
  - Met een linkje dan vanuit overzicht naar gedetailleerde versie.
